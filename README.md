🔍 Exploring the Pokémon API with Python 🐾

I recently created a fun project using Python to interact with the Pokémon API. The script fetches data about a Pokémon by name, ensuring some security with a password-protection layer before accessing the API.

✨ Key Features:

Pokémon Data Retrieval: This script connects to the PokeAPI to fetch detailed information about a specified Pokémon (name, ID, height, weight, etc.).
Password Protection: Before accessing the API, the user is prompted for a password (handled securely using the getpass module), ensuring that only authorized users can retrieve Pokémon data.
Retry Mechanism: If the password is incorrect, the user is prompted to retry or exit the program, adding flexibility and user-friendly interaction.
Interactive Output: Once the correct password is entered, the user inputs a Pokémon name, and the script displays key information in a formatted way, with a fun twist in the weight description for humor! 😊
